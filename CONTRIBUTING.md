## 2. Pick an issue
What do you want to work on? [Choose an issue](https://github.com/VladShurakov/WeatherApp/issues) that you'd like to contribute to.

### Workflow:
1. Browse **[Issues](https://github.com/VladShurakov/WeatherApp/issues)**.
2. Choose an issue that you understand and like.
3. Comment **`I'm on it`** on the issue to let other contributors know that you're working on it.

### Contributing Rules:
1. Comment `I'm on it` to take an issue.
2. Want to work on not in issues? Just **[create a new issue](https://github.com/VladShurakov/WeatherApp/issues/new/choose)**.
3. Do **not** work on assigned issues. Ask the assignee first.
4. If you take an issue, you're blocking others from working on it. Finish it fast or unassign yourself.

## 3. Create a feature branch in your fork
For your issue, make a feature branch in your forked WeatherApp repository.

### Create a new branch
Open a terminal in your cloned forked WeatherApp repository and run: 
```
git checkout -b fix-issue-YOUR_ISSUE_NUMBER
```
_Replace "YOUR_ISSUE_NUMBER" with the id/number of your issue._

## 4. Submit a PR to `main` branch
So far, you should have pushed your work to your feature branch and have tested that it works on a real Android device.
Then final step is to open a pull request to the `main` branch of the [WeatherApp repository](https://github.com/VladShurakov/WeatherApp/pulls)
